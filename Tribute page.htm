    <p id="introduction">
        Irwin Allen Ginsberg was an American poet and writer. Best known for his poem "Howl", Ginsberg denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States. In the 1940s, he became friends with Lucien Carr, William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac, forming the core of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg was a Buddhist who extensively studied Eastern religious disciplines. He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in apartments in New York City's East Village. He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism, and sexual repression, and he embodied various aspects of this counterculture with his views on drugs, sex, multiculturalism, hostility to bureaucracy, and openness to Eastern religions.
